# Automatically deploy your infrastructure using terraform

> This repository is used to automatically deploy infrastructure using [terraform](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform)

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription and permissions to create:
  - Resource Groups, Service Principals, Key Vault, Cosmos DB, Azure Container Registry, Azure Monitor, App Service or AKS (Subscription Owner Role)
- Bash shell (tested on Visual Studio Codespaces, Mac, Ubuntu, Windows with WSL2)
  - Will not work in Cloud Shell or WSL1
- Azure CLI ([download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest))
- Terraform 0.12+ ([download](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html))
- Docker must be installed and running ([download](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))

## Setup

```bash

# Clone this repo if not using Codespaces
git clone https://github.com/wereinse/helium-terraform.git

cd helium-terraform/src/root

```

### Login to Azure

```bash

az login

# show your Azure accounts
az account list -o table

# select the Azure subscription if necessary
az account set -s {subscription name or Id}

```

> All commands require you to be in `helium-terraform/src/root`

### Choose a unique DNS name

```bash
# this will be the prefix for all resources
# only use a-z and 0-9 - do not include punctuation or uppercase characters
# must be at least 5 characters long
# must start with a-z (only lowercase)
export He_Name=[your unique name]

### if true, change He_Name
az cosmosdb check-name-exists -n ${He_Name}

### if nslookup doesn't fail to resolve, change He_Name
nslookup ${He_Name}.azurewebsites.net
nslookup ${He_Name}.vault.azure.net
nslookup ${He_Name}.azurecr.io

```

### Set additional values

```bash

export He_Email=replaceWithYourEmail

# change the location (optional)
export He_Location=centralus

# change the repo (optional - valid: helium-csharp, helium-java, helium-typescript)
export He_Repo=helium-csharp

```

## Deploy `helium`

> Make sure you are in the `helium-terraform/src/root` directory

```bash

# create tfvars file
./create-tf-vars.sh

# initialize
terraform init

# validate
terraform validate

# If you have no errors you can create the resources
terraform apply -auto-approve

# This generally takes about 10 minutes to complete

```

## Verify the deployment

```bash

# check the App Service
curl https://${He_Name}.azurewebsites.net/version
curl https://${He_Name}.azurewebsites.net/api/genres

# check the docker logs from the webv tests
az container logs -g ${He_Name}-rg-webv -n ${He_Name}-webv-${He_Location}

# check Log Analytics
export He_LogAnalytics_Id='az monitor log-analytics workspace show -g ${He_Name}-rg-webv -n ${He_Name}-webv-logs --query customerId -o tsv'

az monitor log-analytics query -w $(eval $He_LogAnalytics_Id) --analytics-query "ContainerInstanceLog_CL | sort by TimeGenerated"

```

You can also log into the Azure portal and browse the new resources

> If the terraform plan command is redirected to a file, there will be secrets stored in that file!
>
> Be sure not to remove the ignore *tfplan* in the .gitignore file
>

## Module Documentation

Each module has a `README` file in the module directory under [`./src/modules/`](./src/modules/). You can reference the module documentation for the specific requirements of each module.

The main calling Terraform script can be found at [`./src/root/main.tf`](./src/root/main.tf)

Customizations are generated by `create-tf-vars.sh` and stored in `terraform.tfvars`.  This file should never be added to github and is included in the .gitignore file.

## Removing the deployment

>
> WARNING - this will delete everything with only one prompt
>

```bash

# this takes several minutes to run
terraform destroy

# delete the service principals
az ad sp delete --id http://${He_Name}-acr-sp
az ad sp delete --id http://${He_Name}-tf-sp

# remove state and vars files
rm terraform.tfstate*
rm terraform.tfvars

```
