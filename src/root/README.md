# Parent Template Properties

This is the parent Terraform Template used to call the component modules to create the infrastructure and deploy  your application.

The only resources created in the template are the resource groups that each Service will go into. It is advised to create a terraform.tfvars file to assign values to the variables in the `variables.tf` file.

To keep sensitive keys from being stored on disk or source control you can set local environment variables that start with TF\_VAR\_\*\*NameOfVariable\*\*. This can be used with the Terraform Service Principal Variables

tfstate usage (not real values)

```shell
export TF_VAR_TF_SUB_ID="gy6tgh5t-9876-3uud-87y3-r5ygytd6uuyr"
export TF_VAR_TF_TENANT_ID="frf34ft5-gtfv-wr34-343fw-hfgtry657uk8"
export TF_VAR_TF_CLIENT_ID="ju76y5h8-98uh-oin8-n7ui-ger43k87d5nl"
